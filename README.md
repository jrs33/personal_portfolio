# personal_portfolio
A personal website I use to centralize my web presence and showcase things I do. I utilized Bootstrap as stylistic foundation and modified it a bit to fit my needs. The site is optimized for desktop usage, but has (imperfect) mobile compatibility as well and is something Im working on improving. Any suggestions/comments are welcome!
