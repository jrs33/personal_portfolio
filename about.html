            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                When I was a kid, I knew I wanted to make a difference like my Mom or Dad had in the world. It was always incredible to hear of my Dads stories as a firefighter/EMT saving people, or my Moms stories as a Health Unit Coordinator, creating a environment to make it easier for doctors to care for their patients. I knew I wanted to use my math and science ability to make my very own impact on healthcare, and wanted to some day start my own initiative to make my mark.<br><br>

                Fast forward to my college years, my parents were ecstatic as I entered Boston University as a first generation college student in their highly ranked Biomedical Engineering program. I went through my first year, and found a love for programming; a great application of my creativity, and engineering ability, and a cool new way to impact archaic healthcare.<br><br>

                Setting these skills into motion, I jumped into some great research positions to get my feet wet. I interned as the only undergrad on a team of surgeons and bioinformatic scientists at MGH, employing Python to target metabolic changes in livers during transplant to aid in drug development. I continued this work at BU my junior year as an intern in an on-campus bioinformatics lab, and switched over to my current Computer Engineering major.<br><br>

                However, I still felt as though I was not making as big of an impact as I'd have liked. It seemed as though my work in academia wasn't bringing me close enough to the healthcare industry I grew up wanting to impact. Disenchanted with research a bit, I applied for industry internships my junior year, and landed a spot at Optum as a Data Engineer.<br><br>

                This is precisely the point in time I write to you today. I want to continue my story and growth in the digital health industry and, in the short term, hope to further data-related projects in a company that will push my engineering skills to the next level, with a long term goal of using my knowledge to further advance digital health initiatives, whether they are my own or a respected peers. I can add value in projects given my experience with tools like:<br><br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>C/C++</li>
                    <li>Java</li>
                    <li>SQL</li>
                    <li>Hadoop</li>
                    <li>Spark</li>
                </ul><br>

                Thank you for taking some time to get to know me, and I encourage you to jump over to my <a href="projects.html"><b>Projects</b></a> page to read more about some of the work I do. Also feel free to download my <a href="SuretteResumePDF.pdf" download><b>Resume</b></a> to further check out my qualifications, and check out my <a href="FAQ.html"><b>Contact</b></a> page to get in touch with me if you think I would be a good addition to your company/project, or if you just want to chat. Thanks!
