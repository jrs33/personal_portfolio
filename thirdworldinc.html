<h1>Description</h1>
<h6>In areas of the world with limited resources, an ever-present cause of death is due to premature births. Particularly in hot areas, it is difficult for the infant to retain water due to limited skin development among other common premature complications. Given the incredibly expensive nature of modern incubators, and the costly training needed to use one, and alternative solution is in need. This is specifically where our incubator came into play. It was made entirely of wood due to the availability of the material and durability. There was also a primitive humidity introduction system that utilized computer fans, a very inexpensive and widely available material. Finally, the heating system ran off of an Arduino and widely available car batteries, and utilized a high power lightbulb to keep the incubator at proper temperature for up to 8 hours a battery charge. It was also user-friendly, with visible humidity/temperature meters and arm holes.</h6> <hr>
<h1>Role</h1>
<h6>I was able to lead a team of three other engineering students to design and create a baby incubator to be used in third world countries within our Sophomore Engineering Design class. In particular, I coded the heating system, which relied on low-cost and highly available car batteries, light bulbs, computer fans and an Arduino as the controlling unit. This also provided user-friendly control with little training, and was a very rewarding experience. </h6>
